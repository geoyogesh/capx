# Junction Capacity Analyser

The Junction Capacity Analyser App is for tansportation planers to assist with planning level operation analysis of junctions. This analysis is one component of a comprehensive intersection control evaluation (ICE) or alternatives analysis. As such, the results of the Junction Capacity Analyser App – overall v/c ratio and multimodal accommodations analysis – should not be the sole basis of choosing a given intersection or interchange form for implementation. It is not intended to be an intersection/interchange form selection tool.

This app is based on CAPX tool (Excel Tool) published by FHWA.
